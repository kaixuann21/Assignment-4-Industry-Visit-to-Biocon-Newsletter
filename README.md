## Reflection
On 23th December 2025，I felt thrilled to visit Biocon Sdn Bhd in Iskandar Puteri, Johor Bahru, which is a 
global biopharmaceutical company. It was an amazing experience for me, as it really gave me a direction in my future career paths.

During the visit, I was able to learn about the drug product packaging process, which allow me to understand how the 
pharmaceutical products are produced in a controlled and highly regulated environment. Before entering the lab, visitors were required 
to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), including a lab coat, head cover, and shoe covers like the staffs. This helped me realised
the importance of hygiene and safety in pharmaceutical manufacturing. Then, we also visited the cool room with the temperature of around 8°C, 
and it was extremely cold! 🥶☃️
Other than that, the staff was very friendly and explained the process clearly as well as answered our questions patiently. 

After the visit, I gained a deeper understanding about the importance of biopharmaceuticals in the field of biology. Besides, it was an 
eye-opening experience that built up my interest in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. My group members and I also do a newsletter 
about the industry visit to Biocon Sdn Bhd.

I was very grateful for having this opportunity to visit Biocon Sdn Bhd. Thank you to Biocon Sdn Bhd for the great visit session.
